This is a project that I did in my free time based on a question posed by my roommate. He wondered about the number of symmetric relations possible between 5 nodes, and since Wikipedia didn't have the answer listed I wrote this program.

Run the program using:

	make
	./main

To change the size of the matrix, edit the value of the variable `size` at the top of `main.c`.
